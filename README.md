## Original Prompt
### Metronome Take-home Code Screen

Attached, find the file `events.csv`, which contains a log of events with the
the format customer\_id, event\_type, transaction\_id, timestamp.

Your task is to write a program that answers the following question:

> How many events did customer X send in the one hour buckets between timestamps A and B.

Choice of language, platform, and libraries is left up to you, as long as the
person evaluating your submission doesn't have to think too hard to figure out
how to run it. We all use recent macOS with recent Docker.

We expect this exercise to take 1-3 hours.

*Bonus:* Include an HTTP service that answers the same question.
